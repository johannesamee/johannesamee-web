Welcome to my personal website! I'm Johannes Am√©e, and this is where I share ideas, notes, and whatever else I'm up to and find interestig.

## What I Do
I write about technology, ideas, and various thoughts that cross my mind. This site serves as my digital notebook and a place to share my perspectives.

### Tech 
There's always a couple of hobby projects related to tech ongoing, usually related to data and information handling, small and large scale.  
Understanding and leveraging AI to maximize benefits and minimize, or at least to be aware of, the downsides.

### Gardening
I keep a container garden on my balcony where I grow a lot of cucumbers, tomatoes, strawberries, broccoli, herbs and more. 

### Literature
I am an avid enjoyer of audio books, and the peak experience is [Graphic Audio](https://www.graphicaudiointernational.net/).  
I've enjoyed all of [Brandon Sanderson's published GA's](https://www.graphicaudiointernational.net/our-productions/authors/a-e/brandon-sanderson.html).
