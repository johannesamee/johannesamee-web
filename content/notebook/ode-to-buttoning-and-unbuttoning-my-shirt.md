> No one knew or at least  
I didn’t know  
they knew  
what the thin disks  
threaded here  
on my shirt  
might give me  
in terms of joy  
this is not something to be taken lightly  
the gift  
of buttoning one’s shirt  
slowly  
top to bottom  
or bottom  
to top or sometimes  
the buttons  
will be on the other  
side and  
I am a woman  
that morning  
slipping the glass  
through its slot  
I tread  
differently that day  
or some of it  
anyway  
my conversations  
are different  
and the car bomb slicing the air  
and the people in it  
for a quarter mile  
and the honeybee’s  
legs furred with pollen  
mean another  
thing to me  
than on the other days  
which too have  
been drizzled in this  
simplest of joys  
in this world  
of spaceships and subatomic  
this and that  
two maybe three  
times a day  
some days  
I have the distinct pleasure  
of slowly untethering  
the one side  
from the other  
which is like unbuckling  
a stack of vertebrae  
with delicacy  
for I must only use  
the tips  
of my fingers  
with which I will  
one day close  
my mother’s eyes  
this is as delicate  
as we can be  
in this life  
practicing  
like this  
giving the raft of our hands  
to the clumsy spider  
and blowing soft until she  
lifts her damp heft and  
crawls off  
we practice like this  
pushing the seed into the earth  
like this first  
in the morning  
then at night  
we practice  
sliding the bones home.  

I feel the importance of giving the small things in life the respect they deserve.

By being mindful and respecting the seriousness of everyday situations we train ourselves to do the same when tragedy hits, or when something amazing happens.

When trained and prepared to face things like loss or death, we can be more present when it knocks on our door. We can give it the respect and praise it deserves when it's not the first time we grapple with concepts like death for example.

There's nothing respectful or intrinsically good in being so devastated by the loss of a close one to the extent that the devastation in you overshadows the life that now is no more.

I want to "practice like this", and by facing life in this way, I also create a new appreciation for my daily experiences.
