> Praise the rain, the seagull dive  
The curl of plant, the raven talk —  
Praise the hurt, the house slack  
The stand of trees, the dignity —  
Praise the dark, the moon cradle  
The sky fall, the bear sleep —  
Praise the mist, the warrior name  
The earth eclipse, the fired leap —  
Praise the backwards, upward sky  
The baby cry, the spirit food —  
Praise canoe, the fish rush  
The hole for frog, the upside-down —  
Praise the day, the cloud cup  
The mind flat, forget it all —  
>  
> Praise crazy. Praise sad.  
Praise the path on which we’re led.  
Praise the roads on earth and water.  
Praise the eater and the eaten.  
Praise beginnings; praise the end.  
Praise the song and praise the singer.  
>  
Praise the rain; it brings more rain.  
Praise the rain; it brings more rain.

What does "Praise" mean to you?

I think Joy wants to show a different praise than I had in mind. A praise that has nothing to do with whether I'm happy or sad, an appreciation, experiencing rain, or the "crazy" and "sad" in a real and truthful way.

"Praise the backwards, upward sky", I don't know what this means but I should praise it all the same. It might mean something to someone else, and by praising it, I also praise that individual.

Be present, and seek a more truthful experience by praising all aspects of life.
