## Embracing the Journey
**How "Life Before Death, Strength Before Weakness, Journey Before Destination" Can Transform Your Daily Life**

In Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series, we encounter a thought-provoking mantra:
> Life before death, Strength before weakness, Journey before destination.

While originating from a fantasy novel, these words offer an interesting perspective on how we might approach our daily lives. Let's explore how this philosophy could potentially influence our everyday decisions and experiences.

### Life Before Death: Choosing to Live Fully
At first glance, "life before death" might seem obvious. Of course, we're alive before we die, right? But this phrase carries a deeper meaning. It's about choosing to truly live, rather than merely exist.

In our daily lives, we often face situations that can make us feel defeated or tempted to give up. Maybe it's a challenging project at work, a strained relationship, or a personal goal that seems out of reach. "Life before death" reminds us to choose life – to keep fighting, to persevere, and to embrace the fullness of our existence.

This principle also extends to how we treat others. By valuing life, we're encouraged to support and uplift those around us, creating a ripple effect of positivity and resilience in our communities.

### Strength Before Weakness: Redefining What It Means to Be Strong
When we hear "strength before weakness," it's easy to conjure images of physical prowess or unwavering stoicism. However, true strength encompasses much more than that.

In our day-to-day lives, strength can manifest in various ways:
- Having the courage to be vulnerable and express your emotions
- Standing up for what's right, even when it's difficult
- Admitting when you're wrong and learning from your mistakes
- Showing compassion and empathy towards others

It's crucial to remember that choosing strength doesn't mean never experiencing weakness. We all have moments of doubt, fear, or vulnerability. The key is to acknowledge these feelings while striving to act from a place of strength and integrity.

### Journey Before Destination: Finding Joy in the Process
In our goal-oriented society, it's easy to become fixated on the end result. We often measure success by achievements, milestones, or material possessions. However, "journey before destination" reminds us that the path we take is just as important – if not more so – than the destination itself.

Applying this principle to everyday life can be transformative:
- Instead of obsessing over a promotion, focus on developing your skills and enjoying your current role.
- Rather than fixating on weight loss goals, celebrate the energy and health benefits that come from regular exercise and nutritious eating.
- When learning a new skill, take pleasure in the process of improvement rather than just aiming for mastery.

By valuing the journey, we open ourselves up to unexpected joys, lessons, and growth opportunities that we might otherwise miss if we're solely focused on the end goal.

### Balancing the Principles
It's important to note that these principles don't exist in isolation. They work together to create a holistic approach to life. For example, choosing "life before death" often requires the strength to persevere through difficulties. Similarly, focusing on the journey helps us appreciate the life we're living right now, rather than always looking to the future.

Moreover, these principles don't negate the importance of their counterparts. Death is an inevitable part of life, we all experience moments of weakness, and reaching our destinations can be incredibly fulfilling. The key is to consciously choose which aspect we focus on and let guide our actions.

### Putting It Into Practice
Incorporating these principles into your daily life doesn't require grand gestures. Start small:
- When faced with a challenge, ask yourself, "How can I choose life in this situation?"
- Reflect on what true strength means to you and look for opportunities to embody that strength.
- Take a moment each day to appreciate where you are on your journey, rather than fixating on where you want to be.

Remember, like any philosophy, this is a guide to help you navigate life's complexities, not a rigid set of rules. Use these principles as a compass to help you make decisions and find meaning in your everyday experiences.

### Conclusion: Philosophy as a Practical Tool
In an age of constant distractions and information overload, it might seem counterintuitive to suggest adding more to think about. But considering ideas like "Life before death, Strength before weakness, Journey before destination" isn't about complicating our lives – it's about finding clarity and purpose in the midst of chaos.

These principles offer a framework for making decisions, big and small. Whether you're choosing a career path, dealing with a difficult relationship, or simply deciding how to spend your evening, these concepts can guide you towards more meaningful choices.

The beauty of philosophy is that it doesn't require a degree or special training – just a willingness to question and reflect. Try this: for the next week, set a daily reminder to spend five minutes thinking about one of these principles. How does it apply to your life? How might it change your actions?

By making philosophy a part of our everyday thinking, we can bring more intention and depth to our lives. In a world that often feels superficial and rushed, this kind of reflection might be exactly what we need.
