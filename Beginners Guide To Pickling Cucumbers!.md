description: "The garden is pumping out cucumbers. We are picking pounds and pounds of them every day soÂ  naturally my mind immediately went to preservation. We have been playing with different methods and different flavors because good pickles can be added to so many dishes but to get high quality pickles can be expensive. Luckily"

Garlic Dill Pickles Instructions:

1. Cut the washed cucumber how you want. I choose to keep them whole for this recipe.
2. To a clean **[32 ounce mason jar](https://www.amazon.com/shop/lifebymikeg)**, pack in the pickles, garlic, sliced onions, and dill flowers.
3. Next, fill up the jar halfway with vinegar. Then fill up the jar the rest of the way with water.
4. Pour out only the liquid into a pot. Add sugar and salt to the pot and bring to a light simmer to dissolve the salt and sugar.
5. Pour the hot brine over the cucumbers, seal and label the jar. Once cooled, place it in the fridge.
6. Let it brine for at least one day to really bring out the flavors!

1/2 Sour PicklesInstruction:

1. Cut the washed cucumber how you want. I choose to keep them whole for this recipe.
2. To a clean mason jar, pack in the cucumbers.
3. Get an **[electronic kitchen scale](https://www.amazon.com/shop/lifebymikeg)**, place the jar filled with cucumbers on, and tare the scale so that it weights zero.
4. Pour water all the way to the top. Get the weight of the water in grams.
5. Take that number and multiply it by.04. This will tell you the correct amount of salt you need in grams.
6. Tare the scale so it reads zero and pour the predetermined amount of salt into the jar. Seal the jar and shake so the salt will dissolve and disburse through out the jar.
7. Label the jar and let ferment for 1-2 days at room temperature. After they are done fermenting, place in the fridge and enjoy!

6. Tare the scale so it reads zero again and pour the predetermined amount of salt into the jar. Seal the jar and shake so the salt will dissolve and disburse through out the jar.
7. Label the jar and let ferment for 3-5 days at room temperature. The fermented flavor preference is really up to you. The more fermented flavor, leave for 5 days. The less fermented flavor, leave for 3 days.
8. After they are done fermenting, place in the fridge and enjoy!

  

5 Day Kimchi Pickle Instructions:

  

1. Cut the washed cucumber how you want. I choose to cut them into coins for this recipe.
2. Add them into a clean 32 ounce mason jar and set aside.
3. To a **[mini food processor](https://www.amazon.com/shop/lifebymikeg)**, add the ginger, onion, garlic, pear, gochugaru flakes, soy sauce, salt, and water. Blend until you have a paste.
4. Dump your sliced cucumbers into a bowl and pour over the paste. Toss to combine and make sure all the cucumbers are coated.
5. Pack the kimchi cucumbers back into the mason jar, place [**a fermentation weight**](https://www.amazon.com/shop/lifebymikeg) on top to make sure the cucumber is under the water line. Within the first few hours the cucumbers will release liquid so you can further push the weight down.
6. Label the jar and seal it. Let it ferment for 3-4 days. Once fermented, place in the fridge and enjoy!

Jarred Pickle Instructions:

1. Start by washing and drying four 32 ounces jars and their lids very well.
2. Next, slice the cucumbers into quarters lengthwise then pack in the pickles into a clean mason jar. Topped each jar with 3 cloves of garlic and 1/4 cup of slice onions to each jar.
3. To a pot add the vinegar, water, salt, sugar, coriander, and black peppercorns. Give it a good whisk until everything dissolves. Evenly distribute the liquid among the four jars.
4. Seal the jar then using **[a canning tong](https://www.amazon.com/shop/lifebymikeg)**, gently place the jars into a water bath at 185F for 30-40 minutes.
5. Once the 30-40 minutes is up, use the canning tongs to pull them out of the water bath. Allow them to cool on a towel and you should hear the cans pop as they cool which means that they are ready to be kept in a cool dark place for long term storage.
