# “Praise the Rain” by Joy Harjo
> Praise the rain, the seagull dive <br/>
The curl of plant, the raven talk — <br/>
Praise the hurt, the house slack <br/>
The stand of trees, the dignity — <br/>
Praise the dark, the moon cradle <br/>
The sky fall, the bear sleep — <br/>
Praise the mist, the warrior name <br/>
The earth eclipse, the fired leap — <br/>
Praise the backwards, upward sky <br/>
The baby cry, the spirit food — <br/>
Praise canoe, the fish rush <br/>
The hole for frog, the upside-down — <br/>
Praise the day, the cloud cup <br/>
The mind flat, forget it all — <br/> <br/>
Praise crazy. Praise sad. <br/>
Praise the path on which we’re led. <br/>
Praise the roads on earth and water. <br/>
Praise the eater and the eaten. <br/>
Praise beginnings; praise the end. <br/>
Praise the song and praise the singer. <br/> <br/>
Praise the rain; it brings more rain. <br/>
Praise the rain; it brings more rain.

What does "Praise" mean to you?

I think Joy wants to show a different praise than I had in mind. A praise that has nothing to do with whether I'm happy or sad, an appreciation, experiencing rain, or the "crazy" and "sad" in a real and truthful way.

"Praise the backwards, upward sky", I don't know what this means but I should praise it all the same. It might mean something to someone else, and by praising it, I also praise that individual.

Be present, and seek a more truthful experience by praising all aspects of life.
