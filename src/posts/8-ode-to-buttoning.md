# “Ode to Buttoning and Unbuttoning My Shirt” by Ross Gay
> No one knew or at least <br/>
I didn’t know <br/>
they knew <br/>
what the thin disks <br/>
threaded here <br/>
on my shirt <br/>
might give me <br/>
in terms of joy <br/>
this is not something to be taken lightly <br/>
the gift <br/>
of buttoning one’s shirt <br/>
slowly <br/>
top to bottom <br/>
or bottom <br/>
to top or sometimes <br/>
the buttons <br/>
will be on the other <br/>
side and <br/>
I am a woman <br/>
that morning <br/>
slipping the glass <br/>
through its slot <br/>
I tread <br/>
differently that day <br/>
or some of it <br/>
anyway <br/>
my conversations <br/>
are different <br/>
and the car bomb slicing the air <br/>
and the people in it <br/>
for a quarter mile <br/>
and the honeybee’s <br/>
legs furred with pollen <br/>
mean another <br/>
thing to me <br/>
than on the other days <br/>
which too have <br/>
been drizzled in this <br/>
simplest of joys <br/>
in this world <br/>
of spaceships and subatomic <br/>
this and that <br/>
two maybe three <br/>
times a day <br/>
some days <br/>
I have the distinct pleasure <br/>
of slowly untethering <br/>
the one side <br/>
from the other <br/>
which is like unbuckling <br/>
a stack of vertebrae <br/>
with delicacy <br/>
for I must only use <br/>
the tips <br/>
of my fingers <br/>
with which I will <br/>
one day close <br/>
my mother’s eyes <br/>
this is as delicate <br/>
as we can be <br/>
in this life <br/>
practicing <br/>
like this <br/>
giving the raft of our hands <br/>
to the clumsy spider <br/>
and blowing soft until she <br/>
lifts her damp heft and <br/>
crawls off <br/>
we practice like this <br/>
pushing the seed into the earth <br/>
like this first <br/>
in the morning <br/>
then at night <br/>
we practice <br/>
sliding the bones home.

I feel the importance of giving the small things in life the respect they deserve.

By being mindful and respecting the seriousness of everyday situations we train ourselves to do the same when tragedy hits, or when something amazing happens.

When trained and prepared to face things like loss or death, we can be more present when it knocks on our door. We can give it the respect and praise it deserves when it's not the first time we grapple with concepts like death for example.

There's nothing respectful or intrinsically good in being so devastated by the loss of a close one to the extent that the devastation in you overshadows the life that now is no more.

I want to "practice like this", and by facing life in this way, I also create a new appreciation for my daily experiences.
