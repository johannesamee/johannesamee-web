# Say hello to www.johannesamee.com
This page should trigger a deploy to the new domain www.johannesamee.com via Vercel.

I'm still having some problems with Vercel and getting it to build correctly so that the new markdown files in `/posts/` that are handled as posts are updated. It seems like it's neither being build when I change files or add new ones.
