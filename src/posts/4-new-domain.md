# Say hello to www.johannesamee.com
I've just finished setting up my new domain and connected it to my hosting, that's still free form Vercel. The overall experience with using GitHub for the repo and Vercel for hosting has been very smooth so far.

This page should trigger a deploy to the new domain www.johannesamee.com via Vercel.

I'm still having some problems with Vercel and getting it to build correctly so that the new markdown files in `/posts/` that are handled as posts are updated. It seems like it's neither being build when I change files or add new ones.
