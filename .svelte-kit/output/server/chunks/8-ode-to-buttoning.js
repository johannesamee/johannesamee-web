I didn’t know <br>
they knew <br>
what the thin disks <br>
threaded here <br>
on my shirt <br>
might give me <br>
in terms of joy <br>
this is not something to be taken lightly <br>
the gift <br>
of buttoning one’s shirt <br>
slowly <br>
top to bottom <br>
or bottom <br>
to top or sometimes <br>
the buttons <br>
will be on the other <br>
side and <br>
I am a woman <br>
that morning <br>
slipping the glass <br>
through its slot <br>
I tread <br>
differently that day <br>
or some of it <br>
anyway <br>
my conversations <br>
are different <br>
and the car bomb slicing the air <br>
and the people in it <br>
for a quarter mile <br>
and the honeybee’s <br>
legs furred with pollen <br>
mean another <br>
thing to me <br>
than on the other days <br>
which too have <br>
been drizzled in this <br>
simplest of joys <br>
in this world <br>
of spaceships and subatomic <br>
this and that <br>
two maybe three <br>
times a day <br>
some days <br>
I have the distinct pleasure <br>
of slowly untethering <br>
the one side <br>
from the other <br>
which is like unbuckling <br>
a stack of vertebrae <br>
with delicacy <br>
for I must only use <br>
the tips <br>
of my fingers <br>
with which I will <br>
one day close <br>
my mother’s eyes <br>
this is as delicate <br>
as we can be <br>
in this life <br>
practicing <br>
like this <br>
giving the raft of our hands <br>
to the clumsy spider <br>
and blowing soft until she <br>
lifts her damp heft and <br>
crawls off <br>
we practice like this <br>
pushing the seed into the earth <br>
like this first <br>
in the morning <br>
then at night <br>
we practice <br>
sliding the bones home.</p></blockquote> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1j92c86">I feel the importance of giving the small things in life the respect they deserve.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-lmz5sx">By being mindful and respecting the seriousness of everyday situations we train ourselves to do the same when tragedy hits, or when something amazing happens.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-18sf7s9">When trained and prepared to face things like loss or death, we can be more present when it knocks on our door.
