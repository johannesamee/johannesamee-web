The curl of plant, the raven talk — <br/>
Praise the hurt, the house slack <br/>
The stand of trees, the dignity — <br/>
Praise the dark, the moon cradle <br/>
The sky fall, the bear sleep — <br/>
Praise the mist, the warrior name <br/>
The earth eclipse, the fired leap — <br/>
Praise the backwards, upward sky <br/>
The baby cry, the spirit food — <br/>
Praise canoe, the fish rush <br/>
The hole for frog, the upside-down — <br/>
Praise the day, the cloud cup <br/>
The mind flat, forget it all — <br/> <br/>
Praise crazy. Praise sad. <br/>
Praise the path on which we’re led. <br/>
Praise the roads on earth and water. <br/>
Praise the eater and the eaten. <br/>
Praise beginnings; praise the end. <br/>
Praise the song and praise the singer. <br/> <br/>
Praise the rain; it brings more rain. <br/>
